# [CrunchBrain](http://hermantran.github.io/crunchbrain/)

### Project Topic and Goals
CrunchBrain is a CrunchBase for hackathons; it provides a database of hackathon projects, events, and collaborators. The goal of the project is to create a platform that helps foster the continued development of hackathon projects beyond the weekend and event that they were created at. This project itself was created as a weekend project for the [DeveloperWeek LA Hackathon](http://la.developerweek.com/hackathon/) event.

### Project Features
* Uses Backbone and RequireJS for code modularity and separation
* Uses Sass for CSS separation and compilation
* Uses Backbone's Router for navigational changes 
* Integrates Windows Azure Mobile Services as an asynchronous datastore
